## grunt-wordpress-deploy Demo Theme

This theme was made for WordCamp New Orleans 2016 for the [Beyond FTP](https://2016.nola.wordcamp.org/session/beyond-ftp/) talk. It helps demonstrate how to integrate and use the [grunt-wordpress-deploy](https://github.com/jambox/grunt-wordpress-deploy) package via the [Grunt WP Deploy Boilerplate](https://github.com/jambox/grunt-wp-deploy-boilerplate) repo.
